The course will revolve around genomics, the science and technology involved in determining the sequence of the entire DNA complement in an organism. Almost everyone has heard of the human genome project, but fewer are aware of the spectacular technical progress in this field and the fact that many thousands of genomes have been sequenced. Until recently, most of these have been microorganisms, but technological and computational progress has made it progressively easier and cheaper to sequence the genomes of higher organisms. This field may have more of an impact on your future lives than almost any other field of the life sciences -  mostly because it touches on all areas of study.  The course will focus on the impact that genomes will have in selected areas. It will begin with a basic understanding of the science and technology that gave rise to our current capabilities in sequencing and the fact that technology continues to provide greater capacity and cheaper prices. You will soon see that every field in the College of  Science is well represented in the science and technology. We will then go on to see how genomics influences many topics that affect our daily lives and can possibly provide answers to some critical questions (or at least pose better questions):  What is the basis of personalized medicine?  What does genomics tell us about the genealogy of mankind?  What impact will genomics have on our future food supply and our ability to feed a population of 9 billion people? What is the human microbiome and what does that mean to me? Similarly, what is the gut microbiome, the mouth microbiome, etc? What impact will genomics have on the development of alternative energy sources, especially biofuels? In every area, we will discuss the scientific challenges, but also the ethical and societal implications.

People and leaders in organizations are constantly working with members of different backgrounds. This course focuses on talent management of gender and diversity for inclusion from an individual employee, leader and team/organizational perspective. When leveraged effectively diversity has the potential to foster learning, creativity, and innovation, but when ignored or misunderstood these differences in identity and values can lead to increased turnover, conflict, stress, talent under-utilization, and harm career experiences and productivity. This goal of this class is to take a multi-level (individual and organization) to help you learn how to lead the management of diversity and inclusion through a) improving your ability to work in diverse teams, as well as b) developing your ability to lead, develop, and implement strategies to foster cultural and structural change to support improved talent management of gender and diversity toward enhanced organizational effectiveness. Men, as well as women, and majority and minority individuals, will be able to leverage the skills taught in this course when making their own career decisions, as well as when managing, being managed by, or collaborating with others; or leading and changing organizations to support new ways of working. From an individual leadership perspective, we begin by tackling the question: \"Why does diversity matter in employing organizations and business, what is the state of the art evidence-based knowledge, and what does it mean to me personally in my career and my leadership beliefs.\" Specifically, we focus on the business and social science processes- including attitudes toward in- groups and out-groups, stereotyping, identity, privilege, and power, discrimination, bias, equity influence opportunity, bystander awareness, and perspective taking- that affect how members of different social groups perceive and interact with one another. Since managing social identity increasingly involves managing work-life boundaries and work and non-work public and private selves, we will also learn about authenticity choices and social and public/ professional identity boundary management.  From an organizational and group perspective, we address the questions \"What are best practices for successful diversity management?\" We will discuss strategies for creating diversity through HR and management practices; how to create an inclusive culture and positive climate for inclusion and talent management, and developing and retaining diverse talent across multiple levels of intervention (individual, group, intergroup, organizational, and societal). We discuss how to conduct an organizational diagnosis of the current diversity climate and barriers and facilitators for   creating a multicultural workplace and a flexible environment supportive of many identities, and how assumptions may vary across industry and cultural contexts. In addition to readings and learning logs, cases, self- reflections and other exercises, students will have a choice of a teachathon project, which will allow them to somewhat customize the course to their own major interest-managing themselves or managing others. Student engagement and a willingness to share diverse perspectives are critical to the success of this course. To facilitate an active classroom, a range of participative learning methods are used, including learning log reflections, case analysis, experiential exercises, small group discussions, and self-assessments, and research projects. The emphasis is on exploiting diverse ways of learning as well as interaction with real-life examples and situations.

This course examines how genes regulate development and function of the brain to ultimately influence behavior. Genetics has come to be an important aspect of research in almost every field of Neuroscience and Psychology ranging from neural development to cognitive function and dysfunction. However, many students have not had the opportunity to explore this in their studies to date. Therefore, the goal of this course is to provide students with the background needed to understand and think critically about the genetic components of Neuroscience and behavioral research. Numerous questions will be explored mainly through discussion of research papers. Lectures by the professor will fill in background knowledge needed to understand the readings. The questions explored will include: What are chromosomes and genes? What do they do? How do they do it? How do genes control development of the brain? How are single genes manipulated in animals to study their effects on behavior? How can genes associated with normal or abnormal behavior be identified? What has been learned from gene-behavior studies in animals? in humans? What do these studies tell us about the nature-nurture controversy? In addition to exploring these more traditional aspects of behavioral genetics we will address the 3 most exciting recent developments. These include the use of transgenic primate models, selective remote control of specific neural circuits using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and epigenetics, which helps explain how environmental factors and behavior itself can change gene activity and how these changes may be transmitted from one generation to the next. Many behaviors could be used to explore the principles these questions address. The readings will be selected from papers that focus on learning & memory and mental illness. However, if students are interested in other behaviors, papers that involve those behaviors and serve our purposes can be substituted. Grading will be based mainly on informal presentations of papers and participation in discussions of these papers.
